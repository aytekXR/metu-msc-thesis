Image Fusion is a computer vision task that has been taken place for many years. Gathering all the complementary usefull informations into single image is called image fusion, \emph{a.k.a} IF. Visual and Infrared Image Fusion, \emph{henceforth will be referred to as VIF}, is a subfield of iamge fusion. Since the first study \cite{toet1989merging} in 1989, VIF is actively studied. In the era of AI, new methods such as CNN, GAN, auto-encoder, transformers are also applied to the VIF problem.
